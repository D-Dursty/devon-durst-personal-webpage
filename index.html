            <h2> About Me</h2>
            <p>Originally from the foothills of Northern California, I've enjoyed Western Washington's abundance of rain, mountain views, sweeping valleys, greenery, and general laid back lifestyle for the last almost-nine years. 
                <br> <br>Since graduating college in 2009 I have explored careers in interior design/project management, food and farming, as well as education. 
                <br><br>
                Other facts about me: <br>
                 I once had an intertidal encounter with a Giant Pacific Octopus: it was both magical, and squeal-inducing.
                 <br> <br>
                 I have a 1.5 year old nephew who immediately captured my heart with his innate curiosity, and love of all things nature (he waves 'hello' to leaves he sees blowing in the wind)...he is also a bag-lady, just like his aunt.<br> 
                 <br> One day I'd love to build a catchy, community sourced curriculum database of k-12 classroom curriculum that incorporates a multitude of "untraditional" teaching methodologies while still covering STEM standards. I would hope to help time, and resource-stressed teachers in engaging students in new, child-led learning experiences.
